% FIGURE: Fighting Force Profiles Comparison
% ==========================================
%
% Content Description:
% Time evolution of bulk wrench magnitude ||F_{i,perp}|| during manipulation
%
% Plot Specifications:
% - X-axis: Time (seconds)
% - Y-axis: Fighting Force ||F_{i,perp}|| (Newtons)
% - Task: Revolute or Prismatic manipulation episode
%
% Three Methods to Compare:
% 1. Pos-Ctrl (Red): High, persistent fighting forces
% 2. Imp-Ctrl (Orange): Reduced but not eliminated forces
% 3. SWIVL (Blue): Consistently low fighting forces
%
% Key Observations to Highlight:
% - Pos-Ctrl: Forces spike during constraint-violating motions
% - Imp-Ctrl: Passive compliance reduces but cannot systematically eliminate
% - SWIVL: Learned impedance modulation maintains low forces throughout
%
% Style:
% - Line plot with shaded confidence intervals (if showing multiple trials)
% - Clear legend
% - Grid lines for readability
%
% Recommended Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, MATLAB
