% FIGURE: Reference Twist Field Generator
% ========================================
% File: reference_twist_field.jpg
% Location: method.tex - Section 3.3 (Stable Imitation Vector Field) 끝부분
% Label: fig:reference_twist_field
%
% Content Description:
% Three-panel diagram showing the 3-step process of generating reference twists
%
% Panel 1 (Left): SE(3) Trajectory Smoothing
% - Input: Sparse action chunks from high-level policy (discrete waypoints)
% - Process: SLERP for rotations, cubic splines for translations
% - Output: Dense desired trajectories T_{sd_i}(t) at control frequency
% - Visual: Show discrete dots → smooth continuous curve
%
% Panel 2 (Center): Body Twist Computation
% - Input: Interpolated SE(3) trajectory T_{sd_i}(t)
% - Process: Differentiation to compute V_i^des(t)
% - Output: Desired body twists in frame {d_i}
% - Visual: Show trajectory with tangent velocity vectors
%
% Panel 3 (Right): Stable Imitation Vector Field
% - Formula: V_i^ref = Ad_{T_{b_id_i}} V_i^des + k_{p_i} E_i
% - Components:
%   * Feedforward term: Ad_{T_{b_id_i}} V_i^des (imitation)
%   * Corrective term: k_{p_i} E_i (stability/error correction)
% - Visual: Vector field arrows showing:
%   * Desired trajectory (dashed line)
%   * Current pose (solid point)
%   * Error vector E_i pointing from current to desired
%   * Reference twist as combination of desired twist + corrective term
%
% Caption (from method.tex):
% "Reference Twist Field Generator. The generator transforms sparse high-level 
% waypoints into dense, stable reference twists. (Left) Sparse action chunks 
% from the high-level policy are interpolated via SE(3) trajectory smoothing. 
% (Center) Body twists V_i^des are computed by differentiation. (Right) The 
% stable imitation vector field combines the desired twist with a pose-error 
% corrective term k_{p_i}E_i, enabling closed-loop reference generation that 
% balances imitation fidelity with robustness to deviations."
%
% Design Suggestions:
% - Use consistent color scheme:
%   * Desired trajectory/pose: Blue
%   * Current pose: Green
%   * Error/correction: Red/Orange
%   * Reference twist: Purple
% - Add mathematical annotations where appropriate
% - Include time axis or frequency labels (10Hz → 100Hz)
